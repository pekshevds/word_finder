# word_finder
finds the most frequently used words


## Why it need

I was inspired to write this program by a desire to simplify the counting of the most frequently used words in text documents. I searched many open sources looking for programs with the desired functionality, but my searches turned out to be fruitless. 

The program I wrote completely solves the problem of counting frequently used words in text documents. 


During the development process, I studied many open sources. Studied a lot of free libraries.


## How to use my program

to run my program on the command line, type python3 word_finder.py [name of your text file]

for example: python3 word_finder.py text.txt
